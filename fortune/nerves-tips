Run `dmesg` to see log messages from device drivers and the Linux kernel.
Nerves also routes kernel log messages to the Elixir logger.

Erlinit is a small program that starts the Erlang VM on boot.
It has many options - especially for debugging startup issues.
%
Nerves automatically reboots devices when the Erlang VM exits.
You can easily disable it in your config file.

  config :nerves, :erlinit, hang_on_init: true
%
Use `mix firmware.unpack` to decompress a local copy of your firmware on host
and inspect the files within before installing on device%
%
See if someone has already implemented support for a sensor or other hardware
device that you have by checking https://elixir-circuits.github.io/.
%
Nerves stores all BEAM files, the Erlang runtime and various support
libraries/apps in a compressed and read-only SquashFS filesystem.
%
Need to write to disk? Use the application partition mounted R/W at `/data`.
%
Configuring the Elixir Logger to show SASL reports can help debug unexpected
GenServer restarts.

  config :logger,
    handle_otp_reports: true,
    handle_sasl_reports: true

Get the default packages for starting a new Nerves project by depending
on `:nerves_pack`. https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_pack/
%
Nerves enables hardware watchdogs and connects them to Erlang's heart feature
to detect and recover from the Erlang VM hanging.

%
Make small code changes to your running application by copy/pasting Elixir
source files at the IEx prompt.
%
Identify your Nerves devices using a unique ID that's already programmed into
the hardware using the boardid command. Try running `cmd("boardid")` in the IEx.
https://github.com/nerves-project/boardid
%
Nerves maintains a set of examples for common use-cases with devices.
https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_examples
%
Use `RingLogger.next` to dump the current log buffer to screen.
%
Run `log_attach` in the IEx to attach the current session to the Elixir logger
for live logs.
%
Get some insights to Nerves internals with this high level overview of the
Nerves architecture and choice to use the BEAM VM. https://youtu.be/VzOaSvTcvU4
%
Run `Nerves.Runtime.revert` to go back to the previously loaded firmware.
%
Use the `RamoopsLogger` backend to store log messages in DRAM that can survive
unexpected reboots. https://github.com/smartrent/ramoops_logger
%
Files saved in /data are persisted across reboots and firmware upgrades.
